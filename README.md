# Getting Started

## Mac Instructions

* Homebrew Installation

If you do not have Homebrew installed yet, you may install it now by copy and pasting this command:

> $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

This installs Homebrew on your device.

Next, ensure Homebrew packages are run before the system versions of the same (which may be dated or not what we want) by executing the following:

> $ echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bash_profile
